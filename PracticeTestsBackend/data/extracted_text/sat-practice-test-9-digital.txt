When companies in the same industry propose
merging with one another, they often claim that the
merger will benefit consumers by increasing
efficiency and therefore lowering prices. Economist
Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of
the United States newspaper market. She modeled a
hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers
and found that subscription prices would rise
following a merger.
Text 2
Economists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have
argued that research on the effect of mergers on
prices has focused excessively on short-term effects,
which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the
case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that
over the long term (several years, in their study), the
efficiency gains realized by merged companies do
result in economic benefits for consumers. 
Based on the texts, how would Focarelli and Panetta
(Text 2) most likely respond to Fan’s findings
(Text 1)?
A) They would recommend that Fan compare the
near-term effect of a merger on subscription
prices in the Minneapolis area with the effect of a
merger in another newspaper market.
B) They would argue that over the long term the
expenses incurred by the merged newspaper
company will also increase.
C) They would encourage Fan to investigate
whether the projected effect on subscription
prices persists over an extended period.
D) They would claim that mergers have a different
effect on consumer prices in the newspaper
industry than in most other industries.

Utah is home to Pando, a colony of about
47,000 quaking aspen trees that all share a single root
system. Pando is one of the largest single organisms
by mass on Earth, but ecologists are worried that its
growth is declining in part because of grazing by
animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could
prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando
start thriving again.
According to the text, why are ecologists worried
about Pando?
A) It isn’t growing at the same rate it used to.
B) It isn’t producing young trees anymore.
C) It can’t grow into new areas because it is blocked

Metal Content of Plants with 
and without Kanamycin 
Exposure 
Many plants lose their leaf color when exposed to
kanamycin, an antibiotic produced by some soil
microorganisms. Spelman College biologist
Mentewab Ayalew and her colleagues hypothesized
that plants’ response to kanamycin exposure involves
altering their uptake of metals, such as iron and zinc.
The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the
plant Arabidopsis thaliana, half of which were
exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a
control group without exposure to kanamycin, and
measured the plants’ metal content five days after
germination.
Which choice best describes data in the graph that
support Ayalew and her colleagues’ hypothesis?
A) The control plants contained higher levels of
zinc than iron, but plants exposed to kanamycin
contained higher levels of iron than zinc.
B) Both groups of plants contained more than
200 parts per million of both iron and zinc.
C) Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in
the control plants but nearly 400 parts per
million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.
D) The plants exposed to kanamycin showed lower
levels of iron and zinc than the control
plants did.

When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic
ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which
minimizes the energy their bodies need to function.
Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come
out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its
metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious
energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska
marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn
less energy keeping warm during these episodes
than they would if they were alone. A researcher
hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels
hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer
bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than
Alaska marmots.
Which choice best describes data from the table that
support the researcher’s hypothesis?
A) The Alaska marmots’ arousal episodes lasted for
days, while the Arctic ground squirrels’ arousal
episodes lasted less than a day.
B) The Alaska marmots and the Arctic ground
squirrels both maintained torpor for several
consecutive days per bout, on average.
C) The Alaska marmots had shorter torpor bouts
and longer arousal episodes than the Arctic
ground squirrels did.
D) The Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts
than arousal episodes, but their arousal episodes
were much shorter than their torpor bouts.

Percentage ofNonhexagonal Cells in 
Hives of Three Honeybee Species 
Honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal
(six-sided) units called cells, in which queens lay
eggs. Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into
nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for
eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though
the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell
size results in a construction problem—it’s hard to
neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of
large cells—that worsens as the difference increases.
To fill in gaps between the sections when building a
hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than
six sides. A student studying beehive structure
consults data on three species, concluding
that blank
Which choice most effectively uses data from the
graph to complete the student’s conclusion?
A) cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size
to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the
western honeybee than in the hives of the
dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.
B) both the western honeybee and the black dwarf
honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for
drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely
deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells.
C) the western honeybee probably relies on many
more geometrical shapes when constructing cell
than either the dwarf honeybee or the
black dwarf honeybee does.
D) the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably
slightly lower in the hives of the western
honeybee than in the hives of the
dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.

ALSOL is a microcredit program in Mexico that
makes small loans to female entrepreneurs who lack
the collateral and credit history to secure financing
from conventional banks. Borrowers use their
business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly
installments and incur no penalty for missed
payments other than lack of access to larger loans.
Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos
analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural
borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts,
miss payments more often than urban borrowers do,
partly because they sell their goods less frequently
than they could. Barboza and Trejos claim that this
behavior reflects strategic decisions that enable rural
women to increase their profits per unit sold.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
Barboza and Trejos’s claim?
A) Many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay
marketplace operators a fixed percentage of each
day’s proceeds in exchange for permission to sell
goods there.
B) Rural entrepreneurs can typically sell their goods
for higher prices in cities than in their home
areas, but the number of people selling
competing goods tends to be higher in cities.
C) Due to the lower costs they incur, rural
entrepreneurs tend to require smaller initial
loans than urban entrepreneurs do. 
D) The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their
goods to towns with marketplaces is high but
largely independent of the number of goods they
bring.

some researchers to speculate that the Arctic woolly
mammoth, an extinct elephantid, might have
exhibited similar behavior. Mammoth tusks grew in
sequential layers, incorporating ingested minerals
and organics, and so each ivory stratum reflects the
ratio of strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) in the local
environment; thus, the sequence of strata shows
where the animal roamed during life. Recent analysis
of the strontium ratios in the strata of one Arctic
woolly mammoth tusk in relation to the geographic

shows the animal’s range begin to expand as it
reached sexual maturity, only to contract again in its

The following text is from Jane Austen’s 1811 novel
Sense and Sensibility. Elinor lives with her younger
sisters and her mother, Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so
effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,
and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,
though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her
mother, and enabled her frequently to
counteract, to the advantage of them all, that
eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which
must generally have led to imprudence. She had
an excellent heart;—her disposition was
affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but
she knew how to govern them: it was a
knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;
and which one of her sisters had resolved never
to be taught.
According to the text, what is true about Elinor?
A) Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to
change her mind.
B) Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to
family matters.
C) Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.
D) Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.

When digging for clams, their primary food, sea
otters damage the roots of eelgrass plants growing
on the seafloor. Near Vancouver Island in Canada,
the otter population is large and well established,
yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those
found elsewhere off Canada’s coast. To explain
this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and
colleagues compared the Vancouver Island
meadows to meadows where otters are absent or
were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the
Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene
pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that
damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of
sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic
diversity, which benefits the meadows’ health overall.
Which finding, if true, would most directly
undermine Foster’s hypothesis?
A) At some sites in the study, eelgrass meadows are
found near otter populations that are small and
have only recently been reintroduced.
B) At several sites not included in the study, there
are large, well-established sea otter populations
but no eelgrass meadows.
C) At several sites not included in the study,
eelgrass meadows’ health correlates negatively
with the length of residence and size of otter
populations.
D) At some sites in the study, the health of plants
unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with
the length of residence and size of otter

In the twentieth century, ethnographers made a
concerted effort to collect Mexican American
folklore, but they did not always agree about that
folklore’s origins. Scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa
claimed that Mexican American folklore derived
largely from the folklore of Spain, which ruled
Mexico and what is now the southwestern United
States from the sixteenth to early nineteenth
centuries. Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by
contrast, argued that while some Spanish influence is
undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the
product of the ongoing interactions of various
cultures in Mexico and the United States.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
Paredes’s argument?
A) The folklore that the ethnographers collected
included several songs written in the form of a
décima, a type of poem originating in late
sixteenth-century Spain. 
B) Much of the folklore that the ethnographers
collected had similar elements from region to
region. 
C) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers
collected was previously unknown to scholars. 
D) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers
collected consisted of corridos—ballads about
history and social life—of a clearly recent origin.

Among social animals that care for their young,
such as chickens, macaque monkeys, and humans,
newborns appear to show an innate attraction to
faces and face-like stimuli. Elisabetta Versace and
her colleagues used an image of three black dots
arranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth
to test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo
tortoises, which live alone and do not engage in
parental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings
showed a significant preference for the image,
suggesting that blank
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless
by newborns of social species that practice
parental care but as threatening by newborns of
solitary species without parental care.
B) researchers should not assume that an innate
attraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an
adaptation related to social interaction or
parental care.
C) researchers can assume that the attraction to
face-like stimuli that is seen in social species that
practice parental care is learned rather than
innate.
D) newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger
preference for face-like stimuli than adult
Testudo tortoises do.

Aptamers—synthetic DNA or RNA molecules that
bind to target molecules—can be used to test for
foodborne bacterial pathogens, though their
specificity (the probability of returning a negative
result in the absence of the focal pathogen) in
real-world foods has been unclear. Sandeep
Somvanshi et al. fabricated test paper incorporating
aptamers targeting strain O157:H7 of the bacteria
Escherichia coli; the paper shifts from pink to purple
as the aptamers bind to target molecules. Somvanshi
et al. tested the paper in store-bought pear juice they
treated with E. coli O157:H7, other strains of E. coli,
or other bacteria species. Following exposure, the
paper from the O157:H7 test was purple while
papers from the other tests were pink, suggesting
that blank
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) aptamer-based tests in real-world foods are more
likely to show a high degree of specificity if the
focal pathogen is E. coli O157:H7 than if the
focal pathogen is another strain of E. coli or
another species.
B) uncertainty about the specificity of
aptamer-based tests for pathogens in real-world
foods may be due to the similarity between
E. coli O157:H7 and other E. coli strains.
C) the specificity of the tests in a real-world food
was unaffected by the aptamers’ tendency to
bind to different strains of E. coli.
D) the aptamers successfully bound to E. coli
O157:H7 and the tests displayed a high degree
of specificity in a real-world food.
