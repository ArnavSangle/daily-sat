In the late 1800s, Spanish-language newspapers 
flourished in cities across Texas. San Antonio alone 
produced eleven newspapers in Spanish between 
1890 and 1900. But El Paso surpassed all other 
cities in the state. This city produced twenty-two 
newspapers in Spanish during that period. El Paso is 
located on the border with Mexico and has always 
had a large population of Spanish speakers. Thus, it 
is unsurprising that this city became such a rich site 
for Spanish-language journalism.

More than 60% of journeys in Mexico City occur via 
public transit, but simply reproducing a feature of 
the city’s transit system—e.g., its low fares—is 
unlikely to induce a significant increase in another 
city’s transit ridership. As Erick Guerra et al. have 
shown, transportation mode choice in urban areas of 
Mexico is the product of a complex mix of factors, 
including population density, the spatial distribution 
of jobs, and demographic characteristics of 
individuals. System features do affect ridership, of 
course, but Start referenced Content: there is 
an irreducibly contextual dimension of transportation mode choice. End referenced Content.

transit ridership solely by altering characteristics 
of a transit system.

Changes to vegetation cover and other human 
activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, 
though how deep these effects extend is unclear. 
Hypothesizing that differences in land use lead to 
differences in carbon and nitrogen levels that are not 
restricted to the topsoil layer (0–30 cm deep), 
Chukwuebuka Okolo and colleagues sampled soils 
across multiple land-use types (e.g., grazing land, 
cropland, forest) within each of several Ethiopian 
locations. They found, though, that across land-use 
types, carbon and nitrogen decreased to comparably 
low levels beyond depths of 30 cm.

presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining 
to that question, and then describes an 
observation made by the team that conflicts with 
that hypothesis. 
C) It discusses a process that scientists are 
somewhat unclear about, introduces competing 
hypotheses about that process, and then explains 
how a research team concluded that one of those 
hypotheses is likely correct. 
D) It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject

Recently, scientists looked at data collected by 
NASA’s InSight lander to learn more about seismic 
activity on Mars, known as marsquakes. The data 
show that the marsquakes all started from the same 
location on the planet. This discovery was surprising 
to scientists, as they expected that the marsquakes 
would originate from all over the planet because of 
the cooling of the planet’s surface. Now, scientists 
believe that there could be areas of active magma 
flows deep beneath the planet’s surface that trigger 
the marsquakes. 
According to the text, what was surprising to 
scientists studying the seismic activity data from 
NASA’s InSight lander? 
A) The surface temperature of Mars has been rising. 
B) There were different types of seismic waves 
causing marsquakes.

scientists had expected.

The ancient writing system used in the Maya 
kingdoms of southern Mexico and Central America 
had a symbol for the number zero. The earliest 
known example of the symbol dates to more than 
2,000 years ago. At that time, almost none of the 
writing systems elsewhere in the world possessed a 
zero symbol. And the use of zero in Mexico and 
Central America may be even more ancient. Some 
historians suggest that Maya mathematicians 
inherited it from the Olmec civilization, which 
flourished in the region 2,400–3,600 years ago. 
According to the text, what do some historians 
suggest about Maya civilization? 
A) Maya civilization acquired the use of zero from 
the Olmec civilization. 
B) Maya civilization respected its historians more 
than it respected its mathematicians. 
C) Maya civilization was highly secretive about its 
intellectual achievements.

The Younger Dryas was a period of extreme cooling

crater from such an impact that dates to the 
beginning of the period. In 2015, a team led by

L. Sebastian Purcell has shown that surviving works

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
•  Scientists have developed a “freeze-thaw” battery 
that can retain 92% of its charge after twelve 
weeks. 
•  The battery contains molten salt (a type of salt 
that liquifies when heated and solidifies at room 
temperature). 
•  When the salt is in a liquid state, energy flows 
through the battery. 
•  When the salt is in a solid state, energy stops 
flowing and is stored in the battery. 
•  The stored (frozen) energy can be used by 
reheating (thawing) the battery. 
The student wants to specify how the salt enables 
energy storage. Which choice most effectively uses 
relevant information from the notes to accomplish 
this goal? 
A) Scientists have developed a freeze-thaw battery 
that contains molten salt, which liquifies when 
heated and solidifies at room temperature. 
B) The stored energy in a freeze-thaw battery, 
which contains molten salt, can be used by 
reheating the battery. 
C) When the molten salt in a freeze-thaw battery 
solidifies at room temperature, energy stops 
flowing and can be stored in the battery. 
D) Molten salt allows a freeze-thaw battery to retain 
92% of its charge after twelve weeks.

Jerome’s 1889 novel Three Men in a Boat (To Say 
Nothing of the Dog). The narrator is traveling by boat 
with Harris and another friend. 
[Harris] told us anecdotes of how he had gone 
across the [English] Channel when it was so 
rough that the passengers had to be tied into 
their [beds], and he and the captain were the 
only two living souls on board who were not ill. 
Sometimes it was he and the second mate who

attribute this incongruity to governments’ 
tendency—not followed in the recent European 
cases—to implement austerity programs strategically 
to avoid electoral costs (e.g., setting spending cuts to

obscured the inherent political risks of austerity 
measures in the election data scholars have 
examined.

Text 1 
Graphic novels are increasingly popular in 
bookstores and libraries, but they shouldn’t be 
classified as literature. By definition, literature tells a 
story or conveys meaning through language only; 
graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and 
use language only sparingly, in captions and 
dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of 
images and not as language, making them more 
similar to film than to literature. 
Text 2 
Graphic novels present their stories through both 
language and images. Without captions and dialogue, 
readers would be unable to understand what is 
depicted in the illustrations: the story results from 
the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison 
Bechdel’s Fun Home and many other graphic novels 
feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose 
found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic 
novels qualify as literary texts. 
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 
most likely respond to the overall argument 
presented in Text 1? 
A) By asserting that language plays a more 
important role in graphic novels than the author 
of Text 1 recognizes 
B) By acknowledging that the author of Text 1 has 
identified a flaw that is common to all graphic 
novels 
C) By suggesting that the story lines of certain 
graphic novels are more difficult to understand 
than the author of Text 1 claims 
D) By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most 
graphic novels aren’t as well crafted as most 
literary works are

The glow from the sunset was making the street

thought. It was swarming with children who 
were playing ball and darting back and forth

Girls were skipping double dutch rope, going

Since its completion in 2014, Bosco Verticale 
(Vertical Forest)—a pair of residential towers in 
Milan, Italy, covered by vegetation—has become a 
striking symbol of environmental sustainability in 
architecture. Stefano Boeri intended his design, 
which features balconies that are home to hundreds 
of trees, to serve as a model for promoting urban 
biodiversity. However, the concept has faced 
skepticism: critics note that although the trees used 
in Bosco Verticale were specifically cultivated for the 
project, it’s too early to tell if they can thrive in this 
unusual setting. 
According to the text, why are some critics skeptical 
of the concept behind Bosco Verticale? 
A) Some essential aspects of Bosco Verticale’s 
design are difficult to adapt to locations other 
than Milan. 
B) The plant life on Bosco Verticale ended up being 
less varied than Boeri had envisioned it 
would be. 
C) The construction of Bosco Verticale was no less 
environmentally damaging than the construction 
of more conventional buildings is. 
D) It is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support 
the plant life included in its design.

Many literary theorists distinguish between fabula, a 
narrative’s content, and syuzhet, a narrative’s 
arrangement and presentation of events. In the film 
The Godfather Part II, the fabula is the story of the 
Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the presentation 
of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 
1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin 
maintained that fabula and syuzhet are insufficient to 
completely describe a narrative—he held that 
systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena 
discount the subtle way in which meaning is created 
by interactions between the artist, the work, and the 
audience. 
Which choice best states the main idea of the text? 
A) Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin argued that 
there are important characteristics of narratives 
that are not fully encompassed by two concepts 
that other theorists have used to analyze 
narratives. 
B) Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin claimed that 
meaning is not inherent in a narrative but is 
created when an audience encounters a narrative 
so that narratives are interpreted differently by 
different people. 
C) The storytelling methods used in The Godfather 
Part II may seem unusually complicated, but 
they can be easily understood when two concepts 
from literary theory are utilized. 
D) Narratives that are told out of chronological 
order are more difficult for audiences to 
understand than are narratives presented 
chronologically.

Fish whose DNA has been modified to include 
genetic material from other species are known as 
transgenic. Some transgenic fish have genes from 
jellyfish that result in fluorescence (that is, they glow 
in the dark). Although these fish were initially 
engineered for research purposes in the 1990s, they 
were sold as pets in the 2000s and can now be found 
in the wild in creeks in Brazil. A student in a biology 
seminar who is writing a paper on these fish asserts 
that their escape from Brazilian fish farms into the 
wild may have significant negative long-term 
ecological effects. 
Which quotation from a researcher would best 
support the student’s assertion? 
A) “In one site in the wild where transgenic fish 
were observed, females outnumbered males, 
while in another the numbers of females and 
males were equivalent.” 
B) “Though some presence of transgenic fish in the 
wild has been recorded, there are insufficient 
studies of the impact of those fish on the 
ecosystems into which they are introduced.” 
C) “The ecosystems into which transgenic fish are 
known to have been introduced may represent a 
subset of the ecosystems into which the fish have 
actually been introduced.” 
D) “Through interbreeding, transgenic fish might 
introduce the trait of fluorescence into wild fish 
populations, making those populations more 
vulnerable to predators.”

Inés Ibáñez and colleagues studied a forest site in 
which some sugar maple trees receive periodic 
fertilization with nitrogen to mimic the broader 
trend of increasing anthropogenic nitrogen 
deposition in soil. Ibáñez and colleagues modeled the 
radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen 
fertilization under three different climate scenarios 
(the current climate, moderate change, and extreme 
change). Although they found that climate change 
would negatively affect growth, they concluded that 
anthropogenic nitrogen deposition could more than 
offset that effect provided that change is moderate 
rather than extreme. 
Which choice best describes data from the graph that 
support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion? 
A) Growth with nitrogen under the current climate 
exceeded growth with nitrogen under moderate 
change, but the latter exceeded growth without 
nitrogen under extreme change.

climate exceeded growth without nitrogen under 
moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth

Some climate models for the western United States predict that while 
total annual precipitation may remain unchanged from the present 
level, precipitation will become concentrated into fewer but more 
intense rain and snow events. University of Texas climate scientist 
Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water 
entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes 
would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues 
concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would 
result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but 
that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline 
concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area. 
Which choice best describes data from the table that support Persad 
and her colleagues’ conclusion? 
A) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, the amount of 
water being used for irrigation will increase 0.4% for surface water 
and 0.9% for groundwater, whereas the amount of water entering 
aquifers will increase 11.0% if baseline precipitation is evenly 
distributed. 
B) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for 
irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas it will increase 9.0% 
for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater if baseline 
precipitation is evenly distributed. 
C) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, the amount of 
water entering aquifers will increase 4.9%, while the amount being 
used for irrigation will increase 0.4% for surface water and 0.9% for 
groundwater. 
D) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for 
irrigation will decline by a small amount, whereas it will increase 
11.0% for surface water and 9.0% for groundwater if baseline 
precipitation is evenly distributed.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
•  A lever is a simple machine consisting of a rigid 
beam and a fulcrum. 
•  The fulcrum is the point about which the beam 
pivots. 
•  The input force (effort) is the force applied to the 
lever. 
•  The output force (load) is the force that the lever 
exerts on another object. 
•  In first-class levers, the fulcrum is located between 
the effort and the load. 
•  In second-class levers, the load is located between 
the effort and the fulcrum. 
The student wants to contrast first-class levers and 
second-class levers. Which choice most effectively 
uses relevant information from the notes to 
accomplish this goal? 
A) In levers, the effort is the force applied to the 
lever; the load, in contrast, is the force that the 
lever exerts on another object. 
B) In first-class and second-class levers, the fulcrum 
and the load are in different locations. 
C) First-class levers are simple machines consisting 
of a rigid beam and a fulcrum, but then again, 
the same is true of second-class levers. 
D) In first-class levers, the fulcrum is located 
between the effort and the load, but in 
second-class levers, the load is located between 
the effort and the fulcrum.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the 
following notes: 
•  Earthquakes start at a point called a “focus” and 
spread out from there as seismic waves. 
•  The two types of seismic waves that travel beneath 
Earth’s surface are primary waves (P waves) and 
secondary waves (S waves). 
•  P waves travel more quickly beneath Earth’s 
surface than do S waves. 
•  P waves compress and expand the ground, causing 
it to move backward and forward. 
•  S waves cause the ground to move from side 
to side. 
The student wants to emphasize a similarity between 
P waves and S waves. Which choice most effectively 
uses relevant information from the notes to 
accomplish this goal? 
A) P waves and S waves both travel beneath Earth’s 
surface, causing the ground to move. 
B) P waves travel away from an earthquake’s 
starting point at a higher rate of speed than do 
S waves. 
C) Spreading out from the focus of an earthquake, 
P waves move the ground backward and 
forward. 
D) Although P waves and S waves start at the same 
point, they behave very differently.

For an electric field passing through a flat surface 
perpendicular to it, the electric flux of the electric 
field through the surface is the product of the electric 
field’s strength and the area of the surface. A certain 
flat surface consists of two adjacent squares, where 
the side length, in meters, of the larger square is 
3 times the side length, in meters, of the smaller 
square. An electric field with strength 29.00 volts per 
meter passes uniformly through this surface, which is 
perpendicular to the electric field. If the total electric 
flux of the electric field through this surface is 
·
4,640 volts
meters, what is the electric flux, in 
·
volts
meters, of the electric field through the larger 
square?
