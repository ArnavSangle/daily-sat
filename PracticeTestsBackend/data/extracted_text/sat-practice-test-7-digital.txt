In 2018, scientists discovered an immense
aggregation of Muusoctopus robustus (pearl
octopuses) along a hydrothermal vent 3,200 meters
beneath the ocean’s surface. Water temperatures at
this site—named the Octopus Garden—climb as high
as 11°C, much warmer than the ambient 1.6°C
 
typical
at this depth. Based on observations made over three
years, scientists concluded that temperatures at the
site likely confer reproductive benefits and that the
site is used exclusively for reproduction—6,000
M. robustus adults, hatchlings, and eggs were
observed at the garden, but no juveniles were
present.
Which statement about M. robustus and the Octopus
Garden is best supported by the text?
A) M. robustus leave the Octopus Garden upon
reaching an intermediary stage of development.
B) The M. robustus population at the Octopus
Garden remains stable despite variations in

The following text is from Thomas Mann’s
1924 novel The Magic Mountain, translated by
John E. Woods in 1995.
The story of Hans Castorp that we intend to tell
here—not for his sake (for the reader will come
to know him as a perfectly ordinary, if engaging
young man), but for the sake of the story itself,
which seems to us to be very much worth telling
(although in Hans Castorp’s favor it should be
noted that it is his story, and that not every story
happens to everybody)—is a story that took
place long ago, and is, so to speak, covered with
the patina of history and must necessarily be told
with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past.
©1995 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.
What does the text most strongly suggest about the
story of Hans Castorp?
A) Though it is true that stories of even the most
uninteresting people are themselves interesting
because all people are unique, the reason this
story is interesting is nonetheless difficult to
understand because of the passage of time.
B) Even though it is a story of a person of no
particular importance, its age and the manner in
which it therefore must be told are both
indicators that the story itself is important.
C) Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential
people, this story must necessarily be related in a
particular way if the reason the story is
consequential is to be made evident to the
audience.
D) It is a remarkable story that happened to an
unremarkable person, though one could
plausibly argue that because the story is valuable,
some of its value accrues to the person at its
center.

A student in a political science course is writing a
paper on Aristotle’s The Politics, in which Aristotle
offers his opinion on political instability and gives
advice on how constitutions can be preserved.
Aristotle observes that different forms of government
can fall in different ways—for example, oligarchies
might grant power to military leaders during
wartime who refuse to relinquish that power during
peacetime—but some methods of preserving order
apply across all forms of government. The student
claims that in particular Aristotle asserts that in a
healthy state obedience to law must be as close to
absolute as possible and that even minor infractions
should not be ignored.
Which quotation from a philosopher’s analysis of
The Politics would best support the student’s claim?
A) “When constructing his argument regarding the
characteristics of a well-functioning government,
Aristotle asserts that ‘Transgression creeps in
unperceived and at last ruins the state,’
illustrating this idea with a comparison to
frequent small expenditures slowly and almost
imperceptibly chipping away at a fortune until it
is ultimately depleted.”
B) “When Aristotle writes on the necessity of
avoiding corruption in government, he proposes
that ‘every state should be so administered and
so regulated by law that its magistrates cannot
possibly make money.’ In particular, he thinks
oligarchies are particularly susceptible to
corruption through bribery.”
C) “When Aristotle considers the health of
constitutions, he states that ‘Constitutions are
preserved when their destroyers are at a distance,
and sometimes also because they are near, for
the fear of them makes the government keep in
hand the constitution.’ He holds that rulers who
wish to see constitutions preserved must
continually remind the populace of the dangers
that would result from a constitutional collapse.”
D) “When contrasting different forms of
government, Aristotle holds that ‘oligarchies
may last, not from any inherent stability in such
forms of government, but because the rulers are
on good terms both with the unenfranchised and
with the governing classes.’ That is, oligarchic
leaders who wish to hold on to power will
introduce members of disenfranchised classes
into government in a participatory role.”

Almost all works of fiction contain references to the
progression of time, including the time of day when
events in a story take place. In a 2020 study, Allen
Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an
observable pattern in such references reflects a shift
in human behavior prompted by the spread of
electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The
researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of
more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries
and cultures, using software to recognize and tally
both specific time references—that is, clock phrases,
such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.—and implied ones, such
as mentions of meals typically associated with a
particular time of day.
Which finding from the study, if true, would most
directly support the researchers’ conclusion?
A) Novels published after the year 1800 include the
clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels
published before the year 1800 do.
B) Novels published after 1880 contain significantly
more references to activities occurring after
10 p.m. than do novels from earlier periods.
C) Among novels published in the nineteenth
century, implied time references become steadily
more common than clock phrases as publication
dates approach 1900.
D) The time references of noon (12 p.m.) and
midnight (12 a.m.) are used with roughly the
same frequency in the novels.

Which choice most effectively uses data from the
graph to complete the statement?
In a study of urban physical expansion, Richa Mahtta
et al. conducted a meta-analysis of more than
300 cities worldwide to determine whether urban
land expansion (ULE) was more strongly influenced
by urban population growth or by growth in gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita, a measure of
economic activity. Because efficient national
government is necessary to provide urban services
and infrastructure that attract economic investment,
Mahtta et al. propose that absent other factors, the
importance of GDP per capita growth to ULE would
likely increase relative to the importance of
population growth as governments become more
efficient. If true, this suggests the possibility
thatblank
A) national governments of countries in Region 1
experienced declines in efficiency in the period
from 2000 to 2014, relative to the period from
1970 to 2000.
B) countries in Region 1 experienced a slower rate
of economic growth in the period from 2000 to
2014 than countries in Region 2 did, despite
increasing national government efficiency in
Region 1.
C) national governments of most countries in
Region 2 became more efficient in the period
from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the
period from 1970 to 2000, but those of several
countries in this region did not.
D) national governments of countries in Region 1
and in Region 2 generally became more efficient
in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had
been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but at
different rates.

A student is researching the Chinese government’s
1992 shift to a market economy that emphasizes
trade liberalization. One means of trade liberalization
involves expanding from ordinary imports into an
emphasis on processing imports, which have
two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm
obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner
without payment and sells the final goods to that
partner, charging for assembly) and processing with
inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw
materials from a trading partner, processes them into
final goods, and sells those goods to whichever
trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that
while initial efforts at trade liberalization were
shaped by Chinese firms’ limited capital, this
situation resolved during the 2000s.
Which choice best describes data from the graph that
support the student’s assertion?
A) Processing imports with inputs were greater than
both ordinary imports and processing imports
with assembly in 2006.
B) From 2000 to 2006, processing imports with
inputs rose much more sharply than processing
imports with assembly did.
C) From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports
with inputs nor processing imports with
assembly were greater than ordinary imports.
D) Processing imports with assembly were greater
in 2006 than processing imports with inputs
in 2000.

unicorn horn, with sensitive nerves. Narwhals are
known for this tusk, but many actually don’t have

To address the susceptibility of materials used in
components of high-performance machinery, such as

fibers for producing aerospace composites. Testing
the thermomechanical properties of several

Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) unlike the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, the
nitrogen-treated SiC fiber can substantially
inhibit creep, provided that temperatures and
loads are consistent.
B) the two polymer-derived SiC fibers likely hold
similar potential for reducing the creep
resistance of materials exposed to stress and
elevated temperatures, thus prolonging the life
span of aerospace machinery. 
C) composites based on the two polymer-derived
SiC fibers have chemical properties that may
improve the mechanical and thermal stability of
aerospace equipment to a greater extent than do
composites based on the nitrogen-treated
SiC fiber.
D) aerospace composites containing the
nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may have the ability to
withstand mechanical stress for a longer period
of time than can aerospace composites
containing either of the two polymer-derived
SiC fibers.

Athens and Sparta. Which choice most effectively
uses relevant information from the notes to
accomplish this goal?
A) According to Allison’s Thucydides trap theory,
whenever “a rising power is threatening to
displace a ruling power,” conflict is likely. 
B) Thucydides wrote that conflict between the two
powers was “inevitable,” although Stewart later
challenged the historical basis of this claim. 
C) According to Stewart, a “clash of cultures”
between Athens and Sparta caused the conflict,
not Athens’s rise.
D) Thucydides explained that conflict was caused by
“the rise of Athens and the fear this instilled in
Sparta,” but Allison disagreed, seeing the conflict
as an example of the Thucydides trap.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the
following notes:
• Researchers in a 2021 study wanted to determine
the rate at which 17 languages conveyed both
information and syllables.
• They calculated the bits of information conveyed
per second (the IR, or information rate).
• The IR was found to be approximately consistent
across the 17 languages (an average of 39 bits per
second).
• They calculated the number of syllables spoken
per second (the SR, or syllable rate).
• Spanish had the second-fastest SR (7.7 syllables
per second).
• Vietnamese had the sixteenth-fastest SR
(5.3 syllables per second).
The student wants to present an overview of the
study’s findings. Which choice most effectively uses
relevant information from the notes to accomplish
this goal?
A) The 2021 study determined the information rate
(IR) of 17 languages in bits of information
conveyed per second.
B) Researchers found that information was
conveyed more quickly in Spanish, at
7.7 syllables per second, than in Vietnamese, at
5.3 syllables per second.
C) Vietnamese had the sixteenth-fastest syllable
rate, lower than that of Spanish, which had the
second-fastest; however, Spanish had the lower
information rate of the two.
D) Though some of the languages differed in
number of syllables spoken per second, all 17
conveyed information at roughly the same rate.

Little is known about how plate tectonics—wherein
slabs of Earth’s crust move over, under, away from,
and against one another—began.Start referenced 
Content:Some researchers contend End referenced Contentthat tectonic movements began around
3 billion years ago, often noting that computer
models of Earth’s mantle temperature at the time
indicate that the mantle would have been sufficiently
molten to enable the plates to move.
Text 2
Ultimately, any plausible claim about the inception
of tectonic movement must rest on empirical
evidence from the geological record. Researcher
Wriju Chowdhury and his team analyzed the
geochemistry of zircon crystals to gain insight into
the chemical composition of the magma from which
the crystals formed and, based on the data,

been occurring as early as 4.2 billion years ago.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2
most likely respond to what “some researchers
contend” as described in Text 1?
A) By suggesting that the temperature of Earth’s
mantle 3 billion years ago was likely insufficient
to allow for the level of tectonic movement
predicted by computer models

Earth’s mantle temperature that reliably predict
the onset of plate tectonics and those that do not
C) By indicating that computer models of Earth’s
mantle temperature are still being improved

helpful for the process of making rubber?
A) Its latex produces rubber of an especially high
quality. 
B) Its bark has a unique structure that makes it easy
to collect latex. 
C) It is able to grow in a wide variety of climates

Early Earth is thought to have been characterized by
a stagnant lid tectonic regime, in which the upper
lithosphere (the outer rocky layer) was essentially
immobile and there was no interaction between the
lithosphere and the underlying mantle. Researchers
investigated the timing of the transition from a
stagnant lid regime to a tectonic plate regime, in
which the lithosphere is fractured into dynamic
plates that in turn allow lithospheric and mantle
material to mix. Examining chemical data from
lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks ranging from
285 million to 3.8 billion years old, the researchers
dated the transition to 3.2 billion years ago. 
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ conclusion?
A) Among rocks known to be older than 3.2 billion
years, significantly more are mantle derived than
lithospheric, but the opposite is true for the
rocks younger than 3.2 billion years. 
B) Mantle-derived rocks older than 3.2 billion years
show significantly more compositional diversity
than lithospheric rocks older than 3.2 billion
years do. 
C) There is a positive correlation between the age of
lithospheric rocks and their chemical similarity
to mantle-derived rocks, and that correlation
increases significantly in strength at around
3.2 billion years old. 
D) Mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion
years contain some material that is not found in
older mantle-derived rocks but is found in older
and contemporaneous lithospheric rocks.

language of present-day Idaho and Utah, and a
southern one, whose best-known representative is
Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire in
Mexico. Lexical similarities across the family,
including of botanical terms, confirm descent from a
single language spoken millennia ago, and the
family’s geographical distribution suggests an origin
in what is now the US Southwest. However,
vocabulary pertaining to maize isn’t shared between

Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) northern Uto-Aztecan tribes likely obtained the
crop directly from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe

maize at roughly the same time as northern
Uto-Aztecan tribes did, though from different
sources.

environment, Frances Rivera-Hernández et al.

sediment, finding that although there are intervals of
coarse grains, most of the sediment consists of fine
grains that show signs of cracking due to episodic
desiccation. Rivera-Hernández et al. concluded that
the coarse grains are sandstone, which tends to be
deposited by flowing water, whereas the fine grains
are mudstone, which is slowly deposited by settling
out of suspension in low-flow water, leading the
