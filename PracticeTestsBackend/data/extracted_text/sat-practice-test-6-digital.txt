Although it can be behind the times, there are 
creative ways to update the show. For example, 
Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her 
show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap,

External shopping cues are a type of marketing that 
uses obvious messaging—a display featuring a new 
product, for example, or a “buy one, get one free” 
offer—to entice consumers to make spontaneous 
purchases. In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui and 
colleagues found that this effect can also be achieved 
with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store’s layout. 
The researchers explain that trying to find items in 
new locations causes shoppers to move through 
more of the store, exposing them to more products 
and increasing the likelihood that they’ll buy an item 
they hadn’t planned on purchasing. 
Which response from a survey given to shoppers 
who made a purchase at a retail store best supports 
the researchers’ explanation? 
A) “I needed to buy some cleaning supplies, but 
they weren’t in their regular place. While I was 
looking for them, I saw this interesting notebook 
and decided to buy it, too.” 
B) “I didn’t buy everything on my shopping list 
today. I couldn’t find a couple of the items in the 
store, even though I looked all over for them.” 
C) “The store sent me a coupon for a new brand of 
soup, so I came here to find out what kinds of 
soup that brand offers. I decided to buy a few 
cans because I had the coupon.” 
D) “This store is larger than one that’s closer to 
where I live, and it carries more products. I came 
here to buy some things that the other store 
doesn’t always have.”

To investigate potential cognitive benefits of taking 
leave from work, psychologist Jan Packer and 
colleagues conducted a six-month study of 
Australian university staff members who took no 
leave from work during the study, took 2–4 days of 
leave, or took 1–5 weeks of leave. Tests of 
attentiveness were administered to participants three 
times during the study: at random for the no-leave 
staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, 
one week following their return to work, and one 
week after the second test administration. After 
analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that 
longer leave times might not confer a greater 
cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.

Under normal atmospheric pressure at Earth’s 
surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network 
stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent 
molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be 
found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds 
and compresses water’s structure, allowing water 
molecules within organisms to permeate proteins 
and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea 
organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to 
extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive 
correlation between the depths that various 
piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a 
compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) 
in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of 
researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces 
water’s compressibility. 
Which finding, if true, would most directly support 
the researchers’ hypothesis? 
A) Water molecules are found to be impervious to 
TMAO even when the water molecules’ 
tetrahedral configuration has been distorted by 
high pressure. 
B) Examination of TMAO’s molecular structure 
shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape 
even as pressure increases. 
C) A positive correlation is found between 
concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which 
water’s molecular structure compresses as 
pressure increases. 
D) Analysis of water’s molecular structure under 
high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are 
more stable when TMAO is present than when it 
is not.

The Cretaceous pterosaur Tupandactylus navigans is

study only skull specimens from T. navigans, though 
it was presumed that, like other pterosaurs, the 
species’s primary form of locomotion was powered 
flight. Examining the fuller skeleton in 2016, Victor 
Beccari and his team determined that T. navigans 
had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually 
long neck—characteristics that, combined with the 
creature’s large-crested head, would have made 
sustained flight difficult and walking upright 
relatively comfortable. Based on these findings the

Researchers have long hypothesized that 
woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in 
North America by humans using spears with grooved 
tips known as Clovis points. One anthropologist 
set out to test this hypothesis. Using a mechanical 
spear-thrower, he launched spears with Clovis 
points into mounds of clay—substitutes for the 
animals’ large bodies. The projectiles generally 
penetrated only a few inches into the clay, an amount 
insufficient to have harmed most woolly mammoths. 
This led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters 
using spears with Clovis points likely weren’t the 
principal drivers of the extinction.

Elizabeth Asiedu has identified a negative correlation 
between the share of developing countries’ 
economies derived from natural-resource extraction 
and those countries’ receipts of foreign investment. 
This may appear counterintuitive—resource 
extraction requires initial investments (in extractive 
technology, for instance) at scales best met by 
multinational corporations—but Asiedu notes that 
natural-resource industries’ boom-bust cycle can 
destabilize local currencies and increase developing 
countries’ vulnerability to external shocks, creating 
levels of uncertainty to which foreign investors are 
typically averse. 
Which choice best states the main idea of the text? 
A) Although it may seem surprising that foreign 
investment declines in developing countries as 
natural-resource extraction makes up a larger 
share of those countries’ economies, that decline 
happens because resource extraction requires 
initial investments too large for foreign investors 
to supply. 
B) Although developing countries tend to become 
less dependent on foreign investment as 
natural-resource industries make up a larger 
share of their economies, this change may not 
occur if the boom-bust cycle of those industries 
destabilizes local currencies or increases 
countries’ vulnerability to external shocks. 
C) Although one might expect that foreign 
investment would increase as natural-resource 
extraction makes up a larger share of developing 
countries’ economies, the opposite happens 
because heavy reliance on natural resources can 
lead to unattractive conditions for investors. 
D) Although foreign investors tend to avoid initial 
investments in natural-resource industries in 
developing countries, foreign investment may 
increase significantly as those industries stabilize 
and the risks associated with them decline.

To understand how temperature change affects 
microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients in 
alpine ecosystems, Eva Kaštovská et al. collected 
plant-soil cores in the Tatra Mountains at elevations 
around 2,100 meters and transplanted them to 
elevations of 1,700–1,800 meters, where the mean air 
temperature was warmer by 2°C. Microorganism-
mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the 
transplanted cores; crucially, microorganism 
community composition was unchanged, allowing 
Kaštovská et al. to attribute the acceleration to 
temperature-induced increases in microorganism 
activity. 
It can most reasonably be inferred from the text that 
the finding about the microorganism community 
composition was important for which reason? 
A) It provided preliminary evidence that 
microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was 
accelerated in the transplanted cores. 
B) It suggested that temperature-induced changes 
in microorganism activity may be occurring at 
increasingly high elevations. 
C) It ruled out a potential alternative explanation 
for the acceleration in microorganism-mediated 
nutrient cycling. 
D) It clarified that microorganism activity levels in 
the plant-soil cores varied depending on which 
microorganisms comprised the community.

Some astronomers searching for extraterrestrial life 
have proposed that atmospheric NH3 (ammonia) can 
serve as a biosignature gas—an indication that a 
planet harbors life. Jingcheng Huang, Sara Seager, 
and colleagues evaluated this possibility, finding that 
on rocky planets, atmospheric NH3 likely couldn’t 
reach detectably high levels in the absence of 
biological activity. But the team also found that on 
so-called mini-Neptunes—gas planets smaller 
than Neptune but with atmospheres similar to 
Neptune’s—atmospheric pressure and temperature 
can be high enough to produce atmospheric NH3. 
Based on the text, Huang, Seager, and colleagues 
would most likely agree with which statement about 
atmospheric NH3? 
A) Its presence is more likely to indicate that a 
planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a 
rocky planet that could support life. 
B) Its absence from a planet that’s not a 
mini-Neptune indicates that the planet probably 
doesn’t have life. 
C) It should be treated as a biosignature gas if 
detected in the atmosphere of a rocky planet but 
not if detected in the atmosphere of a 
mini-Neptune. 
D) It doesn’t reliably reach high enough 
concentrations in the atmospheres of rocky 
planets or mini-Neptunes to be treated as a 
biosignature gas.

As media consumption has become increasingly 
multiplatform and socially mediated, active news 
acquisition has diminished in favor of an attitude 
known as “news finds me” (NFM), in which people 
passively rely on their social networks and ambient 
media environments for information about current 
events. Homero Gil de Zúñiga and Trevor Diehl 
examined data on a representative group of adults in 
the United States to determine participants’ strength 
of NFM attitude, political knowledge, and political 
interest. Although no major election took place 
sufficiently near the study for Gil de Zúñiga and 
Diehl to identify causality between NFM and voting 
behavior, they did posit that NFM may reduce voting 
probability through an indirect effect. 
Which finding, if true, would most directly support 
the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl? 
A) NFM attitude tends to increase in strength as 
major elections approach, and people are 
significantly more likely to vote in major 
elections than in minor elections. 
B) NFM attitude has a strong negative effect on 
political knowledge and interest, and there is 
known to be a strong positive correlation 
between political knowledge and interest and the 
likelihood of voting. 
C) Political interest is known to have a strong 
positive effect on likelihood of voting but shows 
only a weak positive effect on political 
knowledge, and NFM attitude shows little 
correlation with either political knowledge or 
political interest. 
D) The likelihood of voting increases as political 
knowledge increases, and the relationship 
between NFM attitude and political knowledge 
tends to strengthen as the size of people’s social 
networks increases.

A species of Byropsis algae produces toxins to avoid 
being eaten by predators. However, in some cases, 
the toxins the organism uses to protect itself from 
predation actually blank
 its attractiveness to 
predators. The Hawaiian sea slug, for example, not 
only tolerates Byropsis toxins but actually uses them 
for protection in the same way the algae does.

Biographer Michael Gorra notes that the novelist 
Henry James “lived in a world of second thoughts,” 
frequently tinkering with his novels and stories after 
their initial publication. However, the differences 
between the 1881 first edition and the 1908 edition of 
his novel A Portrait of a Lady are extreme, even by 
James’s standards; blank
 some critics regard the 
two editions as two different novels altogether.
