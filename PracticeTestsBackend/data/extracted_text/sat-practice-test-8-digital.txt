Kelp forests grow underwater along the eastern
Pacific Coast. These underwater forests are
important to fish and other marine animals. Ocean
currents can be powerful and rough, making it
difficult for animals to find safe places to hide from
predators. The underwater forests slow down the
currents. This creates a moreblank

The following text is from Sarah Orne Jewett’s 1899
short story “Martha’s Lady.” Martha is employed by
Miss Pyne as a maid.
Miss Pyne sat by the window watching, in her
best dress, looking stately and calm; she seldom
went out now, and it was almost time for the
carriage. Martha was just coming in from the
garden with the strawberries, and with more
flowers in her apron. It was a bright cool evening
in June, the golden robins sang in the elms, and
the sun was going down behind the apple-trees
at the foot of the garden. The beautiful old house
stood wide open to the long-expected guest.

The following text is adapted from Aphra Behn’s
1689 novel The Lucky Mistake. Atlante and Rinaldo
are neighbors who have been secretly exchanging
letters through Charlot, Atlante’s sister.
[Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who
immediately ran into the balcony with it, where
she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture,
leaning his head on his hand: She showed him
the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear
it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched
a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it
while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed
not to hear what he said to it. But never was man
so transported with joy, as he was at the reading
of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the
generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of
the text?
A) It describes the delivery of a letter, and then
portrays a character’s happiness at reading that
letter.
B) It establishes that a character is desperate to
receive a letter, and then explains why another
character has not yet written that letter.
C) It presents a character’s concerns about
delivering a letter, and then details the contents
of that letter.
D) It reveals the inspiration behind a character’s
letter, and then emphasizes the excitement that
another character feels upon receiving that letter.

According to historian Vicki L. Ruiz, Mexican
American women made crucial contributions to the
labor movement during World War II. At the time,
food processing companies entered into contracts to
supply United States armed forces with canned
goods. Increased production quotas conferred
greater bargaining power on the companies’
employees, many of whom were Mexican American
women: Start referenced Content: employees insisted on more favorable benefits, and employers, who were anxious to fulfill the contracts, complied. End referenced Content.

For many years, the only existing fossil evidence of
mixopterid eurypterids—an extinct family of large
aquatic arthropods known as sea scorpions and
related to modern arachnids and horseshoe
crabs—came from four species living on the
paleocontinent of Laurussia. In a discovery that
expands our understanding of the geographical
distribution of mixopterids, paleontologist Bo Wang
and others have identified fossilized remains of a new
mixopterid species, Terropterus xiushanensis, that
lived over 400 million years ago on the
paleocontinent of Gondwana.
According to the text, why was Wang and his
team’s discovery of the Terropterus xiushanensis
fossil significant?
A) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found
by scientists that mixopterids lived more than
400 million years ago.
B) The fossil helps establish that mixopterids are
more closely related to modern arachnids and
horseshoe crabs than previously thought.
C) The fossil helps establish a more accurate
timeline of the evolution of mixopterids on the
paleocontinents of Laurussia and Gondwana.
D) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found by
scientists that mixopterids existed outside the
paleocontinent of Laurussia.

Born in 1891 to a Quechua-speaking family in the
Andes Mountains of Peru, Martín Chambi is today
considered to be one of the most renowned figures of
Latin American photography. In a paper for an art
history class, a student claims that Chambi’s
photographs have considerable ethnographic
value—in his work, Chambi was able to capture
diverse elements of Peruvian society, representing his
subjects with both dignity and authenticity.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the student’s claim?
A) Chambi took many commissioned portraits of
wealthy Peruvians, but he also produced
hundreds of images carefully documenting the
peoples, sites, and customs of Indigenous
communities of the Andes.
B) Chambi’s photographs demonstrate a high level
of technical skill, as seen in his strategic use of
illumination to create dramatic light and shadow
contrasts.
C) During his lifetime, Chambi was known and
celebrated both within and outside his native
Peru, as his work was published in places like
Argentina, Spain, and Mexico.
D) Some of the peoples and places Chambi
photographed had long been popular subjects
for Peruvian photographers.

Researchers hypothesized that a decline in the
population of dusky sharks near the mid-Atlantic
coast of North America led to a decline in the
population of eastern oysters in the region. Dusky
sharks do not typically consume eastern oysters but
do consume cownose rays, which are the main
predators of the oysters.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ hypothesis?
A) Declines in the regional abundance of dusky
sharks’ prey other than cownose rays are
associated with regional declines in dusky shark
abundance.
B) Eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater in
areas with both dusky sharks and cownose rays
than in areas with only dusky sharks.
C) Consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays
in the region substantially increased before the
regional decline in dusky shark abundance
began.
D) Cownose rays have increased in regional
abundance as dusky sharks have decreased in
regional abundance.

In the mountains of Brazil, Barbacenia tomentosa
and Barbacenia macrantha—two plants in the
Velloziaceae family—establish themselves on soilless,
nutrient-poor patches of quartzite rock. Plant
ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa
used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots
of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow
directly into the quartzite, have clusters of fine hairs
near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these
hairs secrete both malic and citric acids. The
researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on
dissolving underlying rock with these acids, as the
process not only creates channels for continued
growth but also releases phosphates that provide the
vital nutrient phosphorus.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the researchers’ hypothesis?
A) Other species in the Velloziaceae family are
found in terrains with more soil but have root
structures similar to those of B. tomentosa and
B. macrantha.
B) Though B. tomentosa and B. macrantha both
secrete citric and malic acids, each species
produces the acids in different proportions.
C) The roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha
carve new entry points into rocks even when
cracks in the surface are readily available.
D) B. tomentosa and B. macrantha thrive even when
transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not
contain phosphates.

Many mosquito repellents contain natural
components that work by activating multiple odor
receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae. As the insects
develop resistance, new repellents are needed.
Ke Dong and her team found that EBF, a molecular
component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can
repel mosquitoes by activating just one odor
receptor—and this receptor, Or31, is present in all
mosquito species known to carry diseases. Therefore,

repellents, it would be most useful toblank

Birds of many species ingest foods containing
carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted
into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be
especially saturated in male birds’ feathers, and
because carotenoids also confer health benefits,
the deeply saturated colors generally serve to
communicate what is known as an honest signal of
a bird’s overall fitness to potential mates. However,
ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found
that males in several species of the tanager genus
Ramphocelus use microstructures in their feathers to
manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper
saturation without the birds necessarily having to
maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These findings
suggest thatblank

A) individual male tanagers can engage in honest

no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I
think, in choosing some play most perfectly
unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater
harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the
elegant written language of some respectable
author than in chattering in words of our own.

Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of
microscopic phytoplankton species can live together
near ocean surfaces competing for the same
resources. According to Start referenced Content:conventional wisdom End referenced Content. , one
species should emerge after outcompeting the rest.
So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many
efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t
uncovered a satisfactory explanation.
Text 2
Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have
connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their
microscopic size. Because these organisms are so
tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each
other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that
water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn
makes it hard for them to move around and interact
with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team,
direct competition among phytoplankton probably
happens much less than previously thought.
Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and
colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the
“conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1?
A) By arguing that it is based on a misconception
about phytoplankton species competing with
one another
B) By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine
replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents
competition between phytoplankton species 
C) By suggesting that their own findings help clarify
how phytoplankton species are able to compete
with larger organisms
D) By recommending that more ecologists focus
their research on how competition among
phytoplankton species is increased with water
density

The following text is adapted from Sylvia Acevedo’s
2018 memoir Path to the Stars: My Journey from Girl
Scout to Rocket Scientist. The narrator is traveling by
car with her family to Mexico City. Mario and Laura
are her brother and sister.
Mario and I played games to see how many
different license plates we could spot, and Laura
liked to look for children in the back seats of the
cars we passed. We were used to the forty-five-
minute drive to El Paso and familiar with the
six-hour ride to Chihuahua, but I wondered
what the long journey to Mexico City would be
like.

In the 1700s and 1800s, European composers
experimented with volume in their musical works.
They did so by increasing the number of musicians
playing in the orchestra. For example, in some of his
operas, German composer Richard Wagner added
more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra.
With more instruments playing at the same time, the
orchestra could play extremely loudly at key
moments in his operas. 
According to the text, how did Richard Wagner
achieve moments of extremely high volume in his
operas?
A) By moving the performances of his operas from
outdoor stages to indoor ones 
B) By increasing the number of musicians playing

Poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec
Empire, relies on difrasismo, or a parallel noun
construction that conventionally operates as a single
metaphor. For example, the common difrasismo in
cuauhtli in ocelotl (literally, “the eagle, the jaguar”)
signifies “warrior.” The device’s function is both
formal—providing structure to lines of verse—and
ritual: semantic relations among the two nouns and
the concept they signify can be tenuous, as in the
previous example, such that difrasismos are often
only intelligible according to the conceptual
associations observed in Aztec ceremonial culture.
Which statement about the difrasismo in cuauhtli in
ocelotl is most strongly supported by the text? 
A) Its metaphorical significance derives from the
semantic equivalence of the two nouns
constituting the difrasismo.
B) Its unintelligibility may cause its formal function
within a line of verse to go unnoticed by
present-day readers.
C) Its apparent obscurity can be resolved when
considered in the proper cultural context.
D) Its frequency in Classical Nahuatl poetry
confirms its intelligibility to the Aztec audience.

Eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith is famed
for his metaphor of the invisible hand, which he
putatively used to illustrate a robust model of how
individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing
their own economic interests. Note “putatively”: as
Gavin Kennedy has shown, Smith deploys this
metaphor only once in his economic writings—to
make a narrow point about the then-dominant
economic theory of mercantilism—and it was largely
ignored until some twentieth-century economists
eager to secure an intellectual pedigree for their views
elevated it to a fully-fledged paradigm. 
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Although Smith is famed for his metaphor of the
invisible hand, the metaphor was largely ignored
until economists in the twentieth century came
to realize that the metaphor was a robust model
that anticipated their own views. 
B) Some twentieth-century economists gave Smith’s
metaphor of the invisible hand a significance it
does not have in Smith’s work, but it is
nevertheless a useful model of how individuals
produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their
own economic interests.
C) Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand has been
interpreted as a model of how individuals acting
in their own interest produce aggregate benefits,
but it was intended as a subtle critique of the
economic theory of mercantilism. 
D) The reputation of Smith’s metaphor of the
invisible hand is not due to the importance of the
metaphor in Smith’s work but rather to the
promotion of the metaphor by some later
economists for their own ends.

A group of researchers working in Europe, Asia, and
Oceania conducted a study to determine how quickly
different Eurasian languages are typically spoken
(in syllables per second) and how much information
they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They
found that, although languages vary widely in the
speed at which they are spoken, the amount of
information languages can effectively convey tends
to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two
languages with very different spoken rates can
nonetheless convey the same amount of information
in a given amount of time. 
Which choice best describes data from the table that
support the researchers’ claim?
A) Among the five languages in the table, Thai and
Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech and
the lowest rates of information conveyed.
B) Vietnamese conveys information at

being spoken at a slower rate.
C) Among the five languages in the table, the
language that is spoken the fastest is also the
language that conveys information the fastest.

the same rate, but Serbian conveys information
faster than Spanish does.

The largest tyrannosaurids—the family of carnivorous dinosaurs
that includes Tarbosaurus, Albertosaurus, and, most famously,
Tyrannosaurus rex—are thought to have had the strongest bites of any
land animals in Earth’s history. Determining the bite force of extinct
animals can be difficult, however, and paleontologists Paul Barrett and
Emily Rayfield have suggested that an estimate of dinosaur bite force
may be significantly influenced by the methodology used in generating
that estimate.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support Barrett
and Rayfield’s suggestion?
A) The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the
lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al.
used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest
estimated maximum.
B) In their study, Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction
analysis to produce an estimated bite force range with a minimum
of 8,000 newtons and a maximum of 34,000 newtons.
C) The bite force estimates produced by Bates and Falkingham and by
Cost et al. were similar to each other, while the estimates produced
by Meers and by Gignac and Erickson each differed substantially
from any other estimate. 
D) The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al.
exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and
Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the
same method to generate their estimates.

Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt
have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of
reverence and wonder typically brought on by
perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable
us to feel more connected to others and thereby
inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along
with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims
to have found evidence for this effect in a recent
study where participants were asked to either gaze up
at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported
to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare
at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.
After one minute, an experimenter deliberately
spilled a box of pens nearby.
Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true,
would most strongly support their claim?
A) Participants who had been looking at the trees
helped the experimenter pick up significantly
more pens than did participants who had been
looking at the building.
B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick
up the pens used a greater number of positive
words to describe the trees and the building in a
postexperiment survey than did participants who
did not help the experimenter.
C) Participants who did not help the experimenter
pick up the pens were significantly more likely to
report having experienced a feeling of awe,
regardless of whether they looked at the building
or the trees.
D) Participants who had been looking at the
building were significantly more likely to notice
that the experimenter had dropped the pens than
were participants who had been looking at the
trees.

It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where
evidence confirms that Native Hawaiians and other
Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant

thousands of miles of ocean separating them from
South America. To explain how the sweet potato
was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo
Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA
of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that
Polynesian varieties diverged from South American
ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia

introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.

The morphological novelty of echinoderms—marine
invertebrates with radial symmetry, usually starlike,
around a central point—impedes comparisons with
most other animals, in which bilateral symmetry on
an anterior-posterior (head to tail) axis through a
trunk is typical. Particularly puzzling are sea stars,
thought to have evolved a headless layout from a
known bilateral origin. Applying genomic knowledge
of Saccoglossus kowalevskii acorn worms (close
relatives of sea stars, and thus expected to have
similar markers for corresponding anatomical
regions) to the body patterning genes of Patiria
miniata sea stars, Laurent Formery et al. observed
activity only in anterior genes across P. miniata’s
entire body and some posterior genes limited to the
edges, suggesting thatblank
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) despite the greater prevalence of anterior genes
in sea stars’ genetic makeup, posterior genes
active at the body’s perimeter are primarily
responsible for the starlike layout that
distinguishes sea stars’ radial symmetry from
that of other echinoderms.
B) contrary to the belief that they evolved from
early ancestors with the bilateral form typical of
many other animals, sea stars instead originated
with an atypical body layout that was neither
bilaterally nor radially symmetrical.
C) although the two species are closely related, there
is only minimal correspondence in the genetic
markers for head, tail, and trunk region
development in P. miniata sea stars and
S. kowalevskii acorn worms.
D) rather than undergoing changes resulting in the
eventual elimination of a head region in their
radial body plan, as previously assumed, sea
stars’ morphology evolved to completely lack a
trunk and consist primarily of a head region.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the
following notes:
• Some sandstone arches in Utah’s Arches National
Park have been defaced by tourists’ carvings.
• Park rangers can smooth away some carvings
using power grinders.
• For deep carvings, power grinding is not always
feasible because it can greatly alter or damage the
rock.
• Park rangers can use an infilling technique, which
involves filling in carvings with ground sandstone
and a bonding agent.
• This technique is minimally invasive.
The student wants to explain an advantage of the
infilling technique. Which choice most effectively
uses relevant information from the notes to
accomplish this goal?
A) To remove carvings from sandstone arches in
Utah’s Arches National Park, power grinding is
not always feasible.
B) Filling in carvings with ground sandstone and a
bonding agent is less invasive than smoothing
them away with a power grinder, which can
greatly alter or damage the sandstone arches.
C) Park rangers can use a power grinding technique
to smooth away carvings or fill them in with
ground sandstone and a bonding agent.
D) As methods for removing carvings from

While researching a topic, a student has taken the
following notes:
• Las sergas de Esplandián was a novel popular in
sixteenth-century Spain.
• The novel featured a fictional island inhabited
solely by Black women and known as California.
• That same century, Spanish explorers learned of
an “island” off the west coast of Mexico.
• They called it California after the island in the
novel.
• The “island” was actually the peninsula now
known as Baja California (“Lower California”),
which lies to the south of the US state of
California.
The student wants to emphasize the role a
misconception played in the naming of a place.
Which choice most effectively uses relevant
information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) The novel Las sergas de Esplandián featured a
fictional island known as California.
B) To the south of the US state of California lies
Baja California (“Lower California”), originally
called California after a fictional place. 
C) In the sixteenth century, Spanish explorers
learned of a peninsula off the west coast of
Mexico and called it California. 
D) Thinking it was an island, Spanish explorers
called a peninsula California after an island in a
popular novel.

The quadratic function g models the depth, in
meters, below the surface of the water of a seal
t minutes after the seal entered the water during a
dive. The function estimates that the seal reached its
maximum depth of 302.4 meters 6 minutes after it
entered the water and then reached the surface of the
water 12 minutes after it entered the water. Based on
the function, what was the estimated depth, to the
nearest meter, of the seal 10 minutes after it entered
the water?
