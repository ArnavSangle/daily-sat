Particularly puzzling are sea stars,\nthought to have evolved a headless layout from a\nknown bilateral origin. Applying genomic knowledge\nof Saccoglossus kowalevskii acorn worms (close\nrelatives of sea stars, and thus expected to have\nsimilar markers for corresponding anatomical\nregions) to the body patterning genes of Patiria\nminiata sea stars, Laurent Formery et al. observed\nactivity only in anterior genes across P. miniata’s\nentire body and some posterior genes limited to the\nedges, suggesting that____\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",

      "despite the greater prevalence of anterior genes\nin sea stars’ genetic makeup, posterior genes\nactive at the body’s perimeter are primarily\nresponsible for the starlike layout that\ndistinguishes sea stars’ radial symmetry from\nthat of other echinoderms.",
      "contrary to the belief that they evolved from\nearly ancestors with the bilateral form typical of\nmany other animals, sea stars instead originated\nwith an atypical body layout that was neither\nbilaterally nor radially symmetrical.",

      "rather than undergoing changes resulting in the\neventual elimination of a head region in their\nradial body plan, as previously assumed, sea\nstars’ morphology evolved to completely lack a\ntrunk and consist primarily of a head region."
